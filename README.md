# RopeBridge: Business Web development project

This is RopeBridge web development project using React, React-Routing, and Express on Node.js server built in AWS.

### ------Version Update Note------

Beta FrontEnd Due: Aug 3, 2019

### ------System Maintenance------

1. Naming Convention: Each page will be constructed with one (PageName)Page.js file and (pagename)comp/ folder.

2. Inside of (pagename)comp/ folder, there will be .jsx components. In case one of this components are used in common, this common component component will be saved in the (pagename)comp/ folder where it first appeared in the project. For example, the Header and Footer of this project first appered in the Home, therefore the Header.jsx and Footer.jsx will be saved in the homecomp/ folder.

3. Styling principle is in-line styling as much as possible. in case of .css file needed, it is allowed one per each (pagename)comp/ folder to keep the file system neat and tidy.

4. This project is using Dynamic Routing using react-routher v 5.0.

### ------React Project Autogenerated Readme------

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
